> ESP32 MCPWM module has not well implemented in the IDF api and Arduino core, here we access the MCPWM registers directly to generate a perfect waveform to control the 24BYJ48 or similar stepper motor accurately!

> âš  A new RTOS task using traditional GPIO control and delay() method is not accurate when the thread is getting busy.
